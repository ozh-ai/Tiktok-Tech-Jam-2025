       "      <td>We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety.

    "\n",
    "- The model correctly identifies advertisements via keyword patterns (URLs, promotional terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-visitor rants are captured with cues like exaggerated complaints or generic negative language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Short or off-topic reviews are flagged as irrelevant.\n",

    "- Most normal reviews contain genuine comments about the location and are accurately classified.\n",

    "# **4. Limitations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current dataset is small; perfect accuracy may not generalize to larger, more diverse reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- XGBoost Classifer might overfit on the data and perform poorly on external datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some overlapping language between ads and normal positive reviews could be misclassified in larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relevancy detection is partially heuristic; additional features like GPS proximity or user history could improve robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **5. Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy as a review quality filter API, flagging potential spam/irrelevant reviews before publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extend the model with additional metadata: user review history, posting time, or location distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider ensemble with transformer embeddings (BERT or RoBERTa) for improved semantic understanding in complex reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continuously evaluate on incoming review data to maintain high accuracy."
